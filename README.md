# Application-Raffle

This project has been done in order to work with Object-Oriented Programming. It is based in developing an online application. 
The application generates different raffles for all the users that participate. Each raffle is related with an advertisement the users see. How much users see this advertisement 
more money is generated and then the prize of the raffle is bigger. After that, the prizes are recollected by the winners.
